    answer:
      'The planner said the floor is concrete at the venue, so there was no need for a dance floor. We will have a DJ and a sound system for dancing, but she did mention, stiletto heels may not be the best idea.',

      'December 16, 2019 is when Simon proposed to Roz. We never wanted a masked wedding or a wedding with any covid issues since we have so many friends and family living all over the globe. We saw that this date was available, it is a special date for us and Roz did not want to wait longer. Four years is long enough! We completely understand the short notice and that most people will not be able to make it.',
